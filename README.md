# C3-Password-Generator-Kyle-Curry

## Description

This Challenge's purpose was to build a password generator using starter code HTML and CSS. I have used what I learned in last weeks modules on JavaScript and API's to implement the best possible password generator. In working on this challenge I found myself deepening my knowledge on how JavaScript works through troubleshooting my code.
